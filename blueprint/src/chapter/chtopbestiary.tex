\chapter{Appendix: A collection of results which are needed in the proof.}\label{ch_bestiary}

In this (temporary, unorganised) appendix we list a whole host of definitions and theorems which were known to humanity by the end of the 1980s and which we shall need. These definitions and theorems will find their way into more relevant sections of the blueprint once I have written more details. Note that some of these things are straightforward; others are probably multi-year research projects. The purpose of this chapter right now is simply to give the community (and possibly AIs) some kind of idea of the task we face. Note also that many of the \emph{definitions} here are yet to be formalised in Lean, and this needs to be done before we can start talking about formalising theorems.

\section{Results from class field theory}


\section{Galois representations}


\section{Algebra}

We need the classification of finite subgroups of $\PGL_2(\overline{\F}_p)$. The answer is that they are all cyclic, dihedral, $A_4$, $S_4$, $A_5$, or isomorphic to $\PSL_2(k)$ or $\PGL_2(k)$ for some finite field of characteristic~$p$. This should at least be easy to state!
