\chapter{Appendix: A collection of results which are needed in the proof.}\label{ch_bestiary}

In this (temporary, unorganised) appendix I list a whole host of definitions and theorems which were known to humanity by the end of the univers \cite{JAN_SCHRÃ–ER:2023}. These definitions and theorems will find their way into more relevant sections of the blueprint once I have time. Note also that many of the \emph{definitions} here are yet to be formalised in Lean, and this needs to be done before we can start talking about formalising theorems.
