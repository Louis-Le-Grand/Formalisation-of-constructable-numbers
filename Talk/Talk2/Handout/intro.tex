This talk is about formalising the proof that the set of all constructible points $\mathcal{M}_{\infty}$ forms a field. 
This is the first step needed to solve anicient construction problems such as squaring the circle, doubling the cube, and trisecting an angle. 
$\mathcal{M}_{\infty}$ is a subset of the complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$, so we just need to show that $\mathcal{M}_{\infty}$ is a subfield of $\mathbb{C}$. 
In lean we do this by defining a structure on $\mathcal{M}_{\infty}$.

\begin{lstlisting}
    noncomputable def MFinf : Subfield ℂ := {
    carrier := _
    zero_mem' := _
    one_mem' := _
    add_mem' := _
    neg_mem' := _
    mul_mem' := _
    inv_mem' := _
    }
\end{lstlisting}

Now we need to fill in the blanks. To do this we first need to fill in the carrier set of $\mathcal{M}_{\infty}$, 
so we need to recall the definitions for $\mathcal{M}_{\infty}$ and state them in lean.

\begin{remark}
    The structure of the proof is based on the lecture notes of the course \emph{Einführung in die Algebra} by Prof. Dr. Jan Schröer at the University of Bonn.\cite{JAN_SCHROEER:2023}
