# Information about the project

Will be here soon™️.

# Questions

Is it a problem that lines and circel are unic by basis?
How would one generlise to unics by range?

## How to generalise the root to complex numbers?
- Using polar coordinates or
- root formula for real and imaginary part

# TODO
- Add $K_i$, $K_{\infty}$ and theorems about them (Not need for the construction proplems)
- Section about conjugtion closed sets and subfields (Not need for the construction proplems)
