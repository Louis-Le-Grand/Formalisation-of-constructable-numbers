This talk is about formalising the proof that the set of all constructible points $\mathcal{M}_{\infty}$ forms a field. 
This is the first step needed to solve ancient construction problems, such as doubling the cube and trisecting an angle. 
$\mathcal{M}_{\infty}$ is a subset of the complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$. Therefore, it is sufficient to demonstrate that $\mathcal{M}_{\infty}$is a subfield of $\mathbb{C}$. 
In lean we do this by defining a structure on $\mathcal{M}_{\infty}$.

\begin{lstlisting}
    noncomputable def MFinf : Subfield â„‚ where
        carrier := _
        zero_mem' := _
        one_mem' := _
        add_mem' := _
        neg_mem' := _
        mul_mem' := _
        inv_mem' := _
\end{lstlisting}

The next step is to complete the blanks. 
This will entail first filling in the carrier set of $\mathcal{M}_{\infty}$. To do this, it is first necessary to recall the definitions of $\mathcal{M}_{\infty}$ and state them in lean.
