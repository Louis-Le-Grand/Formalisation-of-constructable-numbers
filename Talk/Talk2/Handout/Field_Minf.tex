\section{Conclusion}

At last, we have assembled the requisite elements for the construction of the field of constructible numbers $\mathcal{M}_{\infty}$.
\begin{lstlisting}
    noncomputable def MField (M: Set ℂ)(h₀: 0 ∈ M)(h₁: 1∈ M):
            Subfield ℂ where
        carrier := M_inf M
        zero_mem' := by exact M_M_inf M h₀
        one_mem' := by exact M_M_inf M h₁
        add_mem' := by apply add_M_Inf M h₀
        neg_mem' := by apply z_neg_M_inf M h₀
        mul_mem' := by apply mul_M_inf M h₀ h₁
        inv_mem' := by apply inv_M_inf M h₀ h₁
\end{lstlisting}

Now it is just an \verb|instance|, proven by \verb|exact?|. To get the structure of the field. Normally this would be done by \verb|infer_instance|, but I want to show the proof in this talk.
\begin{lstlisting}
    noncomputable instance MField_field (M: Set ℂ)(h₀: 0 ∈ M)
            (h₁: 1∈ M): Field (MField M h₀ h₁) := by
        exact SubfieldClass.toField (Subfield ℂ) (MField M h₀ h₁)
\end{lstlisting}

This can be used to proof that $x\in \mathbb{C}$ is in $\mathcal{M}_{\infty}$ if and only if the degree of $x$ over $\mathbb{Q}(M)$ is of the form $2^n$ for some $n\in \mathbb{N}$.
