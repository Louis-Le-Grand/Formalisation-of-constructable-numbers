I would like to express my gratitude to my advisor, Prof. Dr. Floris van Doorn, for his help during all those times when Lean and I had a different understanding of what a sufficient proof looks like.
Additionally, I am grateful for the encouragement to maintain a broader perspective and to focus on tangible outcomes, as otherwise I would still be engaged in the process of defining a line.

I would like to express my gratitude to Prof. Jan Schr√∂er for providing the impetus for me to attempt to formalise this topic through his stimulating lecture on the subject.

Furthermore, I would like to express my gratitude to my friend Joshua Hendriks, who had to endure an initial, imperfect iteration of this thesis and identify areas for improvement.
